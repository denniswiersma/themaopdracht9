This is a project (to be) carried out with the intent of exploring different aspects of data mining (DM) and machine learning (ML).
To study these DM and ML concepts a dataset, in this case regarding heart disease, is to be analysed. This process consists of these following steps:
- Stating project goals & formulating research questions.
- Performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Preparing/cleaning the dataset.
- Describing the EDA and data preparation results.
- Defining ML algorithm quality metrics & investigate performance.
- Select & optimise algorithms.
- Create a Java wrapper for the ML model. 
- Write a report & project proposal for minor.

## Dataset

Cardiovascular disease gets more prominent by the day. As one of the leading causes of death in the developed world it is an important issue to examine. Getting to know more about this matter and what factors impact risk of complications can therefore be rather interesting.  
The dataset used in this research project contains data from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. It contains over 4000 records and 15 variables.  
A detailed summary of the data and it's variables can be found in the code book file. (Yet to be made)  
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression).
